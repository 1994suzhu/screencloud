ScreenCloud
===========
This is the source code for the ScreenCloud client. ScreenCloud is an easy to use screenshot sharing tool consisting of a cross-platform client and a sharing website: [http://screencloud.net/](http://screencloud.net/)

You can also upload to other services, including your own FTP server, Imgur, Dropbox & Ubuntu One through the use of [plugins](https://github.com/olav-st/screencloud-plugins).
